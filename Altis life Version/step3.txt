add this code to your fn_keyhandler.sqf in  missionfile/core/functions/



//F5 key, Barrier Menu
    case 0x3F: {
        if (side player == WEST) then 
        {
            closedialog 0;
            createdialog "Toni_GUI_BarrierGUI";
        };
   };
   
   
 

 
 
^ This makes the menu open only for cops when the F5 key is pressed
